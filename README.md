# full-ecommerce-website

I have used MongoDB as a database, express as a server, react as my frontend and redux to manage states.

I made this project mainly to practice redux and there is also a previous project of shopping cart implementation but there I didn't used redux.

Soon i will be adding a link to this project for a live view.
